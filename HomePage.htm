        <h2>The Persean Sector</h2>
        <p>
          The Domain of Man is no more. Their countless fleets and innumerable
          armies have been shattered and lost. The comforts of their
          civilization are a distant memory. Cut off from the Star Gate network
          and scattered in isolated pockets throughout the galaxy, humanity is
          trying to recover from the great Collapse.
        </p>
        <h3>In The Beginning</h3>
        <q>
          Anything that happened before interstellar civilization is only
          interesting to weird old scholars and
          <span class="FactionLuddicChurch">Luddics</span> who go on about the
          sins of this and that. I won't waste your time, we'll jump right over
          to the good stuff.
        </q>

        <h3>The Interstellar Diaspora</h3>
        <q>
          Then, in fits and starts, humanity lifted itself on flimsy
          hand-engineered craft set atop crude explosives. In the planets and
          moons above they found unimagined wealth, and with it built the first
          cities and ships worthy of those names. They looked out to the stars
          beyond and wondered what could be there and who would be the first to
          go. Old Earth cast out its dissidents, its unruly dreamers, its
          fanatics, and its utopian ideologues in those first leaking starships
          to build societies fitting their dreams - and sometimes their
          nightmares. The era of the sub-FTL expansion to the first neighbouring
          star systems is rife with legend and half-truth, but those insular
          cultures scattered and mutated, cut off from Old Earth, and created a
          flowering of unique worlds.

        <h3>The Hyperspace Expansion</h3>
        <q>
          The <span class="FactionLuddicChurch">Luddics</span> make a great fuss
          about the significance of the devastation of Old Earth. This author
          will concede that, like stories of the first rockets to escape Old
          Earth's gravity, it possesses the mythological resonance of a sort of
          threshold of history. It allows one to point and say that yes, right
          then is when it all changed. Certain historians describe this event as
          an end to the collective childhood of humanity, though a less romantic
          perspective might reason that the majority of human population and
          industry was almost certainly off-world and increasingly out-of-system
          anyway. The Old Earth was just a symbol by then anyway. It is
          nonetheless a fitting turning point with which to understand the shape
          of human civilization to come.

        <q
          >Nothing was restrained that could be imagined; those journeys of
          years through the holy void were eluded by trespass into hyperspace.
          The KL Device was not the first human sin against God's law of
          causality, but it was the greatest, for it opened wide the unholy
          road. The vast domain of Humanity was united in this molochian pact:
          The Gate-haulers opened the way to each colonized system then, by pen
          or by sword, the onslaught of the Domain's vast armada subjugated each
          world. The far end of cycles of war and occupation found the edge of
          the colonized Hyperspace Expanse. But this was not enough for the
          Domain, driven as it was by a spirit of conquest to never be sated.
          This infernal mechanization lusted on for celestial spheres beyond,
          and beyond, and beyond; it would never stop devouring God's creation.
          Humanity was thence scattered abroad upon the face of the galaxy,
          speaking one tongue, united by the demon Gates in one body of worldly
          law. But we had forgotten the laws of God, mightier than any fusion
          lance. God would remind humanity of its place in this universe.</q

          contemplate/perform a series of scenes which represent the life and
          death of the Prophet Ludd. This “spiritual road” is often a literal
          traversal of space past a number of shrines, dioramas, or live
          re-enactings, the scale of which may vary wildly depending on the
          intended scope of the ritual. The scenes are as follows:</q

            the-one-who-would-become-Ludd’s oneness with the experience of all
            humanity. This allows any individual to put themselves into the role
            of Ludd in the stations of the Path, as subject or observer.
          </li>

            The Witnessing: The one-who-will-become-Ludd leaves a sheltered
            existence and witnesses the misery of the world. Figures encountered
            include some combination of: a starving child ignored in the street,
            a plant growing from a crack in the deck-plates, a radiation-burned
            veteran abandoned by the Armada, a penniless merchant used by his
            partners, a world allowed to choke on ash by those who care only for
            the moment, a scholar who found truth scorned by the prideful, a
            criminal condemned despite her repentance, etc.
          </li>

            The Ecstasy: In which the despairing one-who-will-become-Ludd is

          </li>
          <li class="NoBorder">
            The Teaching: In which Ludd starts spiritual “clubs” for those who

            The First Persecution: In which Ludd is mocked, then physically
            attacked, then hidden from prosecution by followers.
          </li>
          <li class="NoBorder">
            The Exodus: In which Ludd is given a vision by God of a promised

          <li class="NoBorder">

            create a new paradise.
          </li>
          <li class="NoBorder">
            The Second Persecution: In which the followers of Ludd again face

            Sector.

          </li>
          <li class="NoBorder">
            The Arrest: In which Ludd is arrested by Domain authorities; the
            faithful are willing to fight, but again Ludd asks them to lay down
            their arms
          </li>

            The Discontinuity: In which Ludd enters the Gate system and is taken

          we saw in the First AI War in one backwater sector on the Domain's
          frontier. Trust me, anyone who examines the facts can see that
          <span class="FactionTriTachCorp">Tri-Tachyon</span> was prepared to
          make a move. Some would say they even instigated the Collapse using
          some kind of super-AI. Is it a coincidence that the Collapse happened
          just as Domain Battlegroup VI was rotated out of the Sector with
          <span class="FactionHegemony">Battlegroup XIV</span> not yet arrived?
          I don't think so, buddy. The AI mastermind controlling
          <span class="FactionTriTachCorp">Tri-Tachyon</span> had this all

          <span class="FactionHegemony">Hegemony</span> with rising stakes as
          the conflict proceeded. As before, the
          <span class="FactionLuddicChurch">Luddic Church</span> tended to back
          the <span class="FactionHegemony">Hegemony</span> while the

          back <span class="FactionTriTachCorp">Tri-Tachyon</span>, though
          neither openly or enthusiastically. The war resulted in a greatly
          weakened
          <span class="FactionTriTachCorp">Tri-Tachyon</span> Corporation,
          though the personal power of Artemisia Sun was vastly increased within
          <span class="FactionTriTachCorp">Tri-Tachyon</span> due to her ouster
          just before and return just after the greatest defeat of the war.
          Despite the material losses,
          <span class="FactionHegemony">Hegemony</span> internal politics
          recover from the unstable state post-Askonia Crisis as a new
          generation of officer leadership is tested and proven. Both powers end
          up more desperate and depleted, but with stronger leadership. It is a
          peace that cannot last.</q
